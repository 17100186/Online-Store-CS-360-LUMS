# Online-Store-CS-360-LUMS

Project Description
We have chosen One Point as our client. It is an entrepreneurial venture of three students of LUMS which aims to provide low price books and coursepacks to students. Currently it is running on manual methods of book keeping which is done essentially on google forms. It poses a lot of problems for its owners such as:
•	Redundancy of data: data is repeated in several places such as course codes, course titles, prices etc. which is difficult to maintain
•	Too many entries on each sale of book
•	Inefficiency in terms of performance reporting
•	No tracking of sales as per time and relation with the item sold
The problem list continues.
We aim to provide them a one stop solution to all their problems. We will build a unified system which will have the following features. 
1.	Inventory management system
2.	Cash management system
3.	Purchases management system
4.	Sales processing system
The requirements would change as per clients demand and agile development process will be followed throughout.
